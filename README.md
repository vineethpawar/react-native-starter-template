# React Native Quick Starter Boilerplate

Welcome to the React Native Quick Starter Boilerplate! This repository is designed to jumpstart your React Native project with a set of essential features and integrations. With this boilerplate, you can quickly start building your React Native app with confidence.

## Features

### 1. AppCenter Integration
- AppCenter is integrated into this boilerplate, allowing you to automate builds and take advantage of the CodePush feature for seamless over-the-air updates.

### 2. React Navigation
- We've set up a robust navigation architecture using React Navigation, making it easy to navigate between screens and manage your app's routing.

### 3. React Native UI Component Wrappers
- To support utility classes and enhance code readability, we've created React Native UI component wrappers with aliases and additional parameter configurations. These wrappers simplify UI development.

### 4. React Native Reanimated Integration
- This boilerplate integrates React Native Reanimated with React Native v0.72, empowering you to create smooth and performant animations in your app.

### 5. Import Aliases with TypeScript and Babel
- We've configured import aliases in the tsconfig and Babel configuration, making it effortless to import your files using clear and concise aliases.

### 6. SVG Icon Renderer
- Included is a wrapper component for rendering SVG icons with type-supported icon names, providing a convenient way to include icons in your app.

### 7. State Management with Redux
- We've integrated state management with Redux, Redux Saga as middleware, and Redux Toolkit to simplify and enhance your app's state management capabilities.

### 8. Theming
- Customize your app's appearance with theming using a colorToken object. Additionally, we've included Lato as the default font for a clean and modern look.

### 9. Basic Services
- We've included essential services to accelerate your development process:
  - **Authentication Service**: Handle user authentication and authorization.
  - **HTTP Service**: Perform HTTP requests and manage API interactions.
  - **Keychain Service**: Store and retrieve data securely in local storage.
  - **Network Service**: Monitor and manage network connectivity.

### 10. Font and UI Scaling Fixes with PixelRatio
- This boilerplate includes font and UI scaling fixes using PixelRatio to ensure your app's user interface is consistent and responsive across various devices and screen sizes.

### 11. GitHub Workflow Pipeline Checks
- We've added a GitHub workflow pipeline with checks to automate and streamline the development and deployment process. This ensures code quality, linting, and testing before merging changes into the main branch.
